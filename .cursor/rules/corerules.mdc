- Before making changes, read and follow AGENTS.md.
- Prefer the smallest safe change (avoid refactors).
- After code changes, run: npm run lint and npm run build (and fix failures).
- Do not add new dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Keep print/export constraints in mind; see docs/PRINT.md.
- Never commit secrets or keys.
- Do not run git commit or git push unless the user explicitly asks.
