# Release Gate Rules (must follow)

## Required before saying “ready to merge”
- npm ci
- npm run release:check

## Dependency matrix
- If Next major >= 15 and App Router exists (src/app or app):
  - react and react-dom must be >= 19
- eslint-config-next must exactly match next

## Safety
- Never use --force or --legacy-peer-deps
- Never force-push or rewrite history
